# Mad Dog Mccree Remastered Edition C: A Classic Arcade Shooter Revived for PC
  
If you grew up in the 90s, you might remember Mad Dog Mccree, the first live-action laserdisc video game that put you in the role of a gunslinger in the Wild West. The game was a hit in arcades and home consoles, featuring full-motion video (FMV) scenes and interactive shooting gameplay.
  
Now, you can relive the nostalgia of Mad Dog Mccree with the Remastered Edition C from Digital Leisure, a PC CD-ROM version that enhances the original game with improved graphics, sound, and compatibility. The Remastered Edition C also includes two bonus games: Mad Dog II: The Lost Gold and The Last Bounty Hunter, giving you more bang for your buck.

Mad Dog Mccree Remastered Edition C is a faithful recreation of the arcade classic, with the same FMV scenes and gameplay mechanics. You use your mouse to aim and shoot at the enemies that pop up on the screen, while avoiding innocent bystanders and obstacles. You have a limited amount of bullets and lives, so you need to be quick and accurate. The game also features branching paths and multiple endings, depending on your choices and performance.
  
The Remastered Edition C adds some new features to enhance the experience, such as:

- A high-definition video mode that upscales the FMV scenes to 1080p resolution.
- A remastered audio mode that improves the sound quality and adds surround sound effects.
- A compatibility mode that allows you to play the game on modern Windows operating systems (Windows 7 or higher).
- A bonus disc that contains behind-the-scenes footage, interviews, and trivia about the making of Mad Dog Mccree.

If you are a fan of Mad Dog Mccree or FMV games in general, you don't want to miss this opportunity to own a piece of gaming history. Mad Dog Mccree Remastered Edition C is available now from Digital Leisure for $19.99. Order your copy today and get ready to face off against Mad Dog and his gang of outlaws in this thrilling arcade shooter.
  
Mad Dog Mccree is not the only game in the Remastered Edition C package. You also get to enjoy two more FMV games from the same era: Mad Dog II: The Lost Gold and The Last Bounty Hunter. These games follow the same formula as Mad Dog Mccree, but with different settings and characters.
  
Mad Dog II: The Lost Gold is the sequel to Mad Dog Mccree, where you have to track down Mad Dog and his new gang after they escape from jail and steal a map to a hidden gold mine.

The game features more locations, weapons, and endings than the first game.
